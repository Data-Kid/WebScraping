Great experience overall!,5.0,"Dec 19, 2022",Recruiter,Amazing culture and people! The peculiar ways of working are unique but effective.,I can't think of any so far - been loving it here!

Good work life balance,3.0,"Dec 19, 2022",Product Manager,"Good work life balance, lots of time with family. Company respects personal time",Career progression is very slow
"No experience, common sense, or business plan. Cash grab.",1.0,"Dec 19, 2022",Controls Technician,"They pay good. Everyone is faking it or making it up as they go with no plan. Very little pressure to preform well since noone has a clue. If you like liars and listening to BS you can get paid well. If your a politician, clown or car sales man this engineering team will promote you to management with no experience!","Snakes and cash grab people hiring snakes and cash grab people.. I have worked on many engineering teams good and bad. I always heard they were bad but wanted to see the innovation. Its nothing but liars and faking, finding reasons why something can't be done or how to blame someone else or get someone else to do it. The absolute opposite of a engineering problem solving team.. Training the managers who won't promote you or pay you what you deserve. In the future if I see someone with only engineering experience at Amazon on a resume I will laugh in their face."

Pack one Shipper,1.0,"Dec 19, 2022",Packer/Shipper,"Great pay and pay schedule, flexability",1. Stand for over 10 hrs for a task that can be completed sitting down 2. My pay was messed up 3 times then I decided to resign from my position because I couldn't take the inconsistency of pay. I would look forward to a certain amount on payday and get less and have to call and create tickets. 3. Benefits take a while to start 4. The absolutely don't want you to care for your family if they fall ill. I had to care for my spouse and turned in her documentation from the doctor's office and they still held it against me. You can not care for anyone unless it's yourself until you accumulate the hours which takes forever.
Unlike any other,5.0,"Dec 19, 2022",Sr. DevOps Consultant,The culture at Amazon is unlike any other place I've worked before. Everyone is incredibly helpful and invested in *your* success and growth. The overall company's focus on ID&E and a fail-fast-and-frequently approach is amazing as well.,"Sometimes the Leadership Principles feel like they're being droned on, but that's one interesting side effect of having them be such a core focus of culture every day. Overall it's hard to state anything negative from my experience so far."
great benefits,4.0,"Dec 19, 2022",Associate,Excellent benefits and a good salary.,It has long shift hours.
Ch-ch-changes,4.0,"Dec 19, 2022",Senior Technical Recruiter,"I get to work with intelligent, caring, and forward-thinking team members. So many pain points from recruiting are resolved with tools and automation here. I love the onboarding buddy program!","I joined Amazon Ads in August and since that time I have changed Managers, changed to a new team, changed back to my old team, changed my job family focus and the role I am required to complete. All of that happened in the span of 6 weeks, and then we hit a hiring pause. I do not have enough exposure to my role to provide any cons, but if you are someone who does not operate well in a rapidly changing environment, this might not be the best company for you."
Good üëç,5.0,"Dec 19, 2022",Associate,Amazing work culture and good with life balance.,"Less pay, less recognition and growth"

Good salary but not a good job,2.0,"Dec 19, 2022",Anonymous Employee,Salary is above average nm,Workload can be a lot and deficient management
Ehhh,3.0,"Dec 19, 2022",Lead User Experience Designer,Moving to Amazon was a good pay bump. It‚Äôs a large company so there are opportunities to move around (granted the hiring freeze/layoffs affect that).,"Very very very political. For such a large company, it‚Äôs crazy how unorganized and unstructured things are. There is this perception that whole orgs are run as mini-startups so standardized processes are hard to come by. I guess you could say then that there are plenty of opportunities to improve the way things are done, but that can be tough with the speed you are expected to ramp up on. You constantly have to show/quantify your value and that can be very arduous. If you are good at playing that game, kudos to you."
